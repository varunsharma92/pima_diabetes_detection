# pima_diabetes_detection
This repository contains the code for the pima diabetes detection problem from kaggle using Neural Networks.
I have obtained an accuracy of over 80% using a Sequential model and 2 Dense layers having 4 nodes each.

The link to the kaggle competition is given below. Feel free to clone this repo or give any suggestion. :)
